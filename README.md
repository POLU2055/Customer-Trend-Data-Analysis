# Customer Trends Analysis using SQL, Excel, and Power BI

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a customer dataset using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI** to uncover trends and insights related to customer demographics, age distribution, and payment behavior. The project demonstrates how a data analyst explores, analyzes, and visualizes customer data to identify actionable insights.

## Project Overview

As a data analyst, the goal of this project was to understand customer behavior, identify key trends, and summarize findings using SQL queries, Excel, and interactive dashboards. The dataset includes customer IDs, gender, age, and payment methods.

## What I Did

* **Data Exploration (SQL):**

  * Examined dataset structure, checked for missing values, and identified unique values.
  * Filtered, grouped, and aggregated customer data to find trends in demographics and payment behavior.

* **Data Analysis (Excel):**

  * Performed **pivot tables** to summarize customers by gender, age, and payment method.
  * Created charts (bar charts, pie charts, histograms) to visualize distributions and trends.
  * Used formulas to calculate averages, counts, and percentages for better insights.

* **Data Visualization (Power BI / Python):**

  * Built **interactive dashboards** for customer trends, including gender distribution, age distribution, and payment method analysis.
  * Highlighted top customer segments and key patterns for business insights.

## SQL Queries Performed

* Selecting sample rows from the dataset.
* Counting total customers and grouping by gender and payment methods.
* Calculating average age overall and by gender.
* Filtering customers by age ranges and payment methods.
* Identifying most frequent payment methods for specific age groups.
* Handling null values and string-based filters (e.g., IDs starting with 'C1').

## Key Insights

* **Total customers:** 99,457 (Female: 59,482, Male: 39,975).
* **Average age:** ~43 years; similar across genders.
* **Payment trends:** Cash is the most used payment method, followed by Credit and Debit Cards.
* Customers over 60 predominantly use Cash, indicating age-based payment preferences.
* Identified minor missing data with 119 customers having null age values.
* Visualizations made it easier to spot trends and communicate insights effectively.

## Customer Trend Visualizations

* Payment method frequency.
* Overall age distribution.
* Age distribution by payment method.

## Skills Demonstrated

* SQL queries for **data exploration and analysis**.
* Excel: Pivot tables, charts, formula-based analysis.
* Power BI / Python: Interactive dashboards, filters, and visual storytelling.
* Identifying trends and patterns in customer demographics and payment methods.
* Data-driven insights for business decision-making.

## Conclusion

This project provides a **comprehensive overview of customer trends** using SQL, Excel, and Power BI/Python visualizations. It demonstrates the full analytical workflow of a data analyst, from raw data exploration to visualization and insight generation. The repository can serve as a reference for SQL-based analysis, Excel reporting, and dashboard creation.
